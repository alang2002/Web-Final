    <p>I'm a huge gamer myself, and I'd like to list some of my favorite gaming systems, as well as a game to go with each.</p>
    <p>Here is a chart of my favorite gaming systems and their ranking:</p>
    <table>

    <p>This one may seem pretty generic, but I've always been a fan of PC gaming over anything on a console. You can get higher framerates and better graphics than console ports, and access to most games (except console exclusives, looking at you Sony).</p>
    <p>I also really enjoy the keyboard and mouse control over a controller, except for a few select games (such as fighting games where button mashing is essential).</p>
    <p>The game that I most enjoy on PC is <i>Battlefield One</i>. I think that most shooter and FPS games handle much better on PC due to mouse control, which allows for finer tuning. However, this game in particular I love the most on PC, as I own it on both console and PC.</p>
