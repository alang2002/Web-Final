    <p>After finishing this web design course, I feel confident in my abilities to code in HTML and CSS. They are both a bit basic, but they can be used for very creative purposes and make up almost all of the web we use today.</p>
    <p>HTML is easy because it uses a simple hierarchy system, but CSS is more fun because it allows you to stylize pages and keep all the code in one file for easy editing.</p>
    <p>If I had to choose one web language to learn though, I would definitely pick Javascript. It seems similar to other OOP programming languages I've learned, and there is a lot of scripts and such that could be written that would be a lot of fun. Plus, I'd love to try and make a game in a web browser.</p>
