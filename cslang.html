    <h1 class="page-header-big">Programming Languages</h1>
    <p>Over the years in high school I've taken plenty of computer science classes, and learned lots of programming languages. Some of the ones I know are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Python</li>
      <li>Java</li>
      <li>C++</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I have the least amount of experience with Python, the second most with C++, and Java the most. I know Java pretty well and it's a fun language to use, despite it's flaws.</p>
    <p>Here is my <a href="https://github.com/AALASL/final">C++ final project</a>. We made Blackjack, with ASCII text graphics and all to go along with it.</p>
    <p>This is my <a href="https://github.com/FinalProject23/JavaProject">Java final project</a>. It's not as well done or as flashy as the C++ final, however it was a lot of fun to work on. We made Hangman and Tic Tac Toe in Java.</p>
    <p>There are a lot of programming languages out there that I still want to learn, like Ruby and Perl. However the one I want to learn the most is C or C#. The C language seems to be really important and well known, especially for game development. I'm hoping to be taking a C# course next year.</p>
